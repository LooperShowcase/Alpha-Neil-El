    SpaceX is a company that builds and launches rockets and spacecraft. It was started by Elon Musk in 2002. Their goal is to make space travel cheaper and even take people to places like the Moon and Mars.
    
    They make rockets like Falcon 9, which can be reused by landing back on Earth after a launch, and Starship, a big spaceship designed for long trips in space. SpaceX also helps send satellites into orbit and carries supplies to the International Space Station. Theyâ€™re working to make space more accessible for everyone! </p>
