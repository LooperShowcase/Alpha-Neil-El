<p> is a remarkable species known for its ability to shoot jets of water to knock insects and other prey off overhanging branches or plants. 
Using their specialized mouths, they can shoot a stream of water with incredible precision, sometimes up to 2 meters (6.5 feet) away.
This fish can even adjust the angle of the water jet to compensate for factors 
like gravity and distance, making it a master marksman in the aquatic world!

<Li>more facts about the archerfish!
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>Archerfish have an exceptional sense of depth perception, which is key to their ability to accurately
  shoot water at prey above the surface. They are able to calculate the refraction of light through water
  to determine the correct angle and distance to hit their target. his skill is so precise that some studies 
  have shown rcherfish can even adjust their aim if the target is at different distances or angles, making
  them one of the most visually sophisticated fish species!

  <p>  üêü Fact about salmon:</p>
  Salmon are anadromous, which means they are born in freshwater, migrate to the ocean to grow and mature, and then return 
  to freshwater to spawn. Amazingly, they often return to the exact river where they were born, using their incredible sense
  of smell to navigate! üåä

<p>The parrotfish plays a critical role in maintaining coral reef ecosystems by eating algae that can
  smother  coral and by excreting sand after consuming coral. In fact, a single parrotfish can produce up to 200 pounds 
  of sand per year, helping create the beautiful white sandy beaches we love! üê†

<p>The mudskipper is a fish that can live both in water and on land! They use their pectoral fins to "walk" " on muddy surfaces and
  can breathe through their skin and the lining of their mouth as long as they stay moist.  These fish even build mud burrows 
  to protect their eggs from predators and changing tides. üåäüêü

<div><p>The pufferfish, also known as a blowfish, can inflate itself like a balloon to ward off predators. What's even cooler is that their skin
and internal organs contain tetrodotoxin, a poison that's 1,200 times more lethal than cyanide. Despite this, in Japan, the pufferfish
(called fugu) is considered a delicacy, prepared only by highly trained chefs! <div>
